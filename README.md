# CPSC 304 Group 40 
# Project Description:
The application allows users to plan meals, build grocery lists, and track their nutritional intake. Users can select from a database of recipes, customize their meal plans for a week, and generate corresponding grocery lists. The system will track recipes, ingredients, user preferences (like allergies and a preferred grocery store), and meal schedules.

### Note: 
The SQL script needed to initialize the database can be found under the Project_Template directory in the file mealplan.sql.
