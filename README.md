# Project Description:
The application allows users to plan meals, create grocery lists, and track their nutritional intake. Users can select from a database of recipes, customize their meal plans for a week, and generate corresponding grocery lists. The system will track recipes, ingredients, user preferences (like allergies and a preferred grocery store), and meal schedules.
